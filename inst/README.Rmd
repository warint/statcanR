# Overview

Easily connect to Statistics Canada's Web Data Service with R. Open economic data (formerly known as CANSIM tables, now identified by Product IDs (PID)) are accessible as a data frame, directly in the user's R environment.


## Shiny App : statcanR ExploR

<img src="man/figures/shiny.png" />

For people less comfortable with R and to allow more people to have access to our package, we have also developed a Shiny application.Through the same logic present in our package, researchers can retrieve data from Statistics Canada. 

statcanR EploR is available [[here]]( https://warin.ca/shiny/statcanr/)

## Installation

The released version of statcanR package is accessible through CRAN and devtools.

``` r
install.packages("statcanR")

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('warint/statcanR')
```

## Example

This section presents an example of how to use the `statcanR` R package and its function `statcan_data()` and `statcan_download_data()`.    
  
The following example is provided to illustrate how to use the functions. It consists in collecting some descriptive statistics about the Canadian Labour Force at the federal, provincial and industrial levels, on a monthly basis.  

With a simple web search 'statistics canada wages by industry metropolitan area monthly', the table number can easily be found on Statisitcs Canada's webpage. Here is below a figure that illustrates this example, such as '27-10-0014-01' for the Federal expenditures on science and technology, by socio-economic objectives.

Once the table number is identified, the statcan_data() function is easy to use in order to collect the data, as following:

``` r
library(statcanR)
mydata <- statcan_data("27-10-0014-01","eng")
```

For the `statcan_download_data()` function there is no difference on how to use it, the only difference is that this function allow you to download the data in a csv file on top of having the data in your environment.

``` r
library(statcanR)
mydata <- statcan_download_data("27-10-0014-01","eng")
```
