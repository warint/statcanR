# Overview

Easily connect to Statistics Canada’s Web Data Service with R. Find and 
access open economic data (formerly known as CANSIM tables, now identified by
Product IDs (PID)) which are accessible as a data frame, directly in the
user’s R environment.



## Shiny App : statcanR ExploR

<img src="man/figures/shiny.png" />

For people less comfortable with R and to allow more people to have
access to our package, we have also developed a Shiny
application.Through the same logic present in our package, researchers
can retrieve data from Statistics Canada.

statcanR ExploR is available [\[here\]](https://warin.ca/shiny/statcanr/)

## Installation

The released version of statcanR package is accessible through CRAN and
devtools.

``` r
install.packages("statcanR")

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('warint/statcanR')
```

## Example

This section presents an example of how to use the `statcanR` R package
and its functions: `statcan_search()`, `statcan_data()`, and 
`statcan_download_data()`.

The following example is provided to illustrate how to use the
functions. It consists in collecting some descriptive statistics about
the Canadian Labour Force at the federal, provincial and industrial
levels, on a monthly basis.

To identify a relevant table, the statcan_search() function can be used
by using a keyword or set of keywords and specifying the language in which the 
data will be presented (English or French). Below is an example that reveals
the data tables we could be interested in:

``` r
library(statcanR)
statcan_search(c("federal","expenditures","objectives"),"eng")
```

Notice that for each corresponding table, the unique table number identifier is 
also presented. Let's focus the first table out of the two that appear, which 
contains data on Federal expenditures on science and technology,
by socio-economic objectives. Once this table number is identified
(‘27-10-0014-01’), the statcan_data() function is easy
to use in order to collect the data, as following:

``` r
library(statcanR)
mydata <- statcan_data("27-10-0014-01","eng")
```

For the `statcan_download_data()` function there is no difference on how
to use it, the only difference is that this function allow you to
download the data in a csv file on top of having the data in your
environment.

``` r
library(statcanR)
mydata <- statcan_download_data("27-10-0014-01","eng")
```

When you file a bug report, please spend some time making it easy for me to follow and reproduce. The more time you spend on making the bug report coherent, the more time I can dedicate to investigate the bug as opposed to the bug report.

##### Contributing to the package development

To get started, consider either adding a new example or enhancing the existing documentation.

If you're interested in submitting a Pull Request to include your own functions, please include the following:

- The code for the new function(s), complete with roxygen annotations and sample usage.
- A dedicated section in the relevant vignette that explains how to utilize the new function.

To ensure your changes are compliant, run rhub::check_for_cran() using rhub. After submission, your Pull Request will undergo automated evaluation via GitHub Actions, allowing you to monitor for any issues.
