\details{
The
\code{statcan_data()} function has 2 arguments to fulfill to get data: {tableNumber} & {lang}.


The tableNumber argument simply refers to the table number of the Statistics Canada data table a user wants to collect,
such as '27-10-0014-01' for the Federal expenditures on science and technology, by socio-economic objectives, as an example.


To get the table number: \url{https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data}.

The second argument, lang, refers to the language. As Canada is a bilingual country, Statistics Canada displays all the economic data in both languages.
Therefore, users can choose to collect satistics data tables in French or English by setting the lang argument with c('fra', 'eng').

\examples{
#mydata <- statcan_data('27-10-0014-01', 'eng')
